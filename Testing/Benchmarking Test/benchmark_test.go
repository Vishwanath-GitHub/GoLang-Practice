/*Benchmarking is a way to test the performance of code. Itâ€™s useful when we want to test
the performance of different solutions to the same problem and see which solution performs better.
It can also be useful to identify CPU or memory issues for a particular piece of code that might be critical to the performance of our application.
Benchmarking can be used to test different concurrency patterns*/
